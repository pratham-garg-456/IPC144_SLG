## This is the GitHub page for the questions we will be doing during the sessions.
#### The answers might (not necessarily) be uploaded every Saturday night. If you have any other solution better than mine it works. Email that to me at Pratham.garg@senecapolytechnic.ca for now and we will also add that.
## About Resource Folder
