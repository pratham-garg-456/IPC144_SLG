-------------------------pointers----------------------------------------

1. create a int named as 'value' which stores the value of 5.

2. create a integer pointer named as ptr which stores the address of value.

3. create a function named "addPBV" which takes a int variable as a parameter and adds five into the value of the integer received as parameter.

4. create a funtion name "addPBA" which takes address of a integer variable as a parameter and adds five into the value stored at the address received as parameter.
