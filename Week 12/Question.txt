Imagine we are developing a simple library management system. To represent the books and their details create the following data structures:

Book:
	1. A Cstring to store the type of the book
	//Type of book: Fiction, Non-Fiction, Reference, etc.
	2. A Cstring to store the ISBN of the book
	// ISBN : (13 digits)

LibraryMember:
	1. integer to store memberID
	2. A Cstring to store the name of the library member
	3. A Book type to store the details of the book borrowed.

Note: Create appropriate macros for the size.

Your task is to implement the following function:

void displayAllMembers(const LibraryMember members[], int max, int format): Display all library members' data in the specified format.

#define MAX_MEMBERS 100

int main() {
    LibraryMember members[MAX_MEMBERS];
    int memberCount = 0;
    displayAllMembers(members, memberCount, 1);
}
