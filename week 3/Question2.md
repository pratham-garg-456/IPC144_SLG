### Write a C program that compares two integers, num1 and num2, and assigns the result of the comparison to a variable result. If the sum of num1 and num2 is even, set result to 1; otherwise, set it to 0. Display the values of num1, num2, and result.

#### Sample Output:
Enter an integer (num1): 7

Enter another integer (num2): 5

Sum of 7 and 5 is even: 1
